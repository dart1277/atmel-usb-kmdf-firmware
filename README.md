# atmel-usb-kmdf-firmware
This firmware was created to demonstrate how to use MS Windows [USB KMDF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/samples/microsoft/windows-driver-samples/wdf-sample-driver-learning-lab-for-osr-usb-fx2/) sample driver with Atmel uCs.
The firmware works similar to the [sample board](http://osrfx2.sourceforge.net/) which is currently not in production [purchase link](https://www.amazon.com/stores/OSR/USBFX2LearningKit/page/C0D6C555-D018-4C05-9E39-8F9400DA0DDD)
(no firmware sources of the original board were used during development).
The firmware was developed using [Atmega](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/ATmega32u4) board, NXP LPC1768 port also exists which was used as a basis to create a university lecture on embedded USB programming.
